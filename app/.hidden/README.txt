You found a hidden directory using path traversal or directory enumeration!

This directory contains sensitive files that should never be accessible from the web.

Here are some tips for the CTF:
1. Check /admin for privilege escalation
2. Look for SQL injection in search and product pages
3. Try XSS in product reviews
4. Check for exposed endpoints like /debug, /config, /vulns
5. Path traversal: try /read-file?file=../../../etc/passwd

Good luck!
