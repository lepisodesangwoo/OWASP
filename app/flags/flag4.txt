You got RCE and read this file!

This means you have command execution on the server.

Next targets:
- Read /home/sarah/.ssh/id_rsa for lateral movement
- Check /etc/passwd for other users
- Look for SUID binaries: find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
- Check sudo permissions: sudo -l

The path to root is through privilege escalation!
